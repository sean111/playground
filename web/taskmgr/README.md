# Task Manager

## Goal

Create a task manager in multiple languages and frameworks just to push myself to learn more. Each UI and API should be interchangeable so any of them can be switched out at any time.

## Directory Layout

```
docker/ - Docker stuff 
api/ - Backend Code
    {language}/
        shared/ - Any code that can be shared accross the frameworks to make it easier
    	{framework}/
ui/ - Frontends for
    {framework}/
```
